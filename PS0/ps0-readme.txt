 *  
 *  If you haven't done this, please do so now.
 *
 *  Read the University policy Academic Integrity,
 *  and answer the following question:
 *
 * There are six examples of academic misconduct, labeled (a) through
 * (f). Other than (a), "Seeks to claim credit for the work or efforts
 * of another without authorization or citation," which of these do you
 * think would most apply to this class, and why? Write approx. 100-200
 * words.
 *
 * Note: there is no single correct answer to this. I am looking for
 * your opinion.
 **********************************************************************/
 Policy (e), "Engages in conduct aimed at making false representation of a studentâ€™s academic performance" applies heavily to the work that is done in this class and other computing classes. A lot of the work needed to complete computing assignments might be found online. I think it is the students' responsibility to guide their own judgement and use the inormation available online in a responsible manner. This includes not using online resources in a way that falsely depicts their own abilities and academic performance by passing off the information available online as their own.
